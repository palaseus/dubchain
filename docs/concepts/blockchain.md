# Blockchain Fundamentals

This document explains the core blockchain concepts implemented in DubChain.

## What is a Blockchain?

A blockchain is a distributed ledger technology that maintains a continuously growing list of records (blocks) that are linked and secured using cryptography. Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data.

## Core Components

### Blocks
Blocks are the fundamental units of a blockchain. Each block contains:

- **Block Header**: Metadata about the block
- **Block Body**: List of transactions
- **Hash**: Cryptographic hash of the block contents
- **Previous Hash**: Hash of the previous block (creates the chain)

### Transactions
Transactions represent value transfers or state changes:

- **Inputs**: References to previous transaction outputs
- **Outputs**: New value assignments
- **Signatures**: Cryptographic proof of ownership
- **Fees**: Transaction fees for miners/validators

### Consensus Mechanisms
Consensus mechanisms ensure all nodes agree on the state of the blockchain:

- **Proof of Work (PoW)**: Miners compete to solve cryptographic puzzles
- **Proof of Stake (PoS)**: Validators are chosen based on stake
- **Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS)**: Stakeholders vote for delegates
- **Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT)**: Consensus among known validators

## DubChain Implementation

### Block Structure
```python
class Block:
    def __init__(self, index, timestamp, transactions, previous_hash, nonce=0):
        self.index = index
        self.timestamp = timestamp
        self.transactions = transactions
        self.previous_hash = previous_hash
        self.nonce = nonce
        self.hash = self.calculate_hash()
```

### Transaction Structure
```python
class Transaction:
    def __init__(self, sender, recipient, amount, fee=0):
        self.sender = sender
        self.recipient = recipient
        self.amount = amount
        self.fee = fee
        self.timestamp = time.time()
        self.signature = None
```

### Blockchain Validation
```python
def is_valid_chain(chain):
    for i in range(1, len(chain)):
        current_block = chain[i]
        previous_block = chain[i-1]
        
        # Check hash integrity
        if current_block.hash != current_block.calculate_hash():
            return False
            
        # Check chain linkage
        if current_block.previous_hash != previous_block.hash:
            return False
            
    return True
```

## Key Properties

### Immutability
Once a block is added to the blockchain, it cannot be modified without invalidating all subsequent blocks.

### Decentralization
No single entity controls the blockchain. Multiple nodes maintain copies of the ledger.

### Transparency
All transactions are visible to all participants in the network.

### Security
Cryptographic hashing and digital signatures ensure data integrity and authenticity.

## Advanced Features

### Smart Contracts
Self-executing contracts with terms directly written into code:

```python
class SmartContract:
    def __init__(self, code, address):
        self.code = code
        self.address = address
        self.state = {}
    
    def execute(self, function_name, args):
        # Execute contract function
        pass
```

### Cross-Chain Interoperability
Ability to transfer assets and data between different blockchains:

```python
class CrossChainBridge:
    def __init__(self, source_chain, target_chain):
        self.source_chain = source_chain
        self.target_chain = target_chain
    
    def transfer_asset(self, asset, amount, recipient):
        # Lock asset on source chain
        # Mint equivalent on target chain
        pass
```

### Sharding
Horizontal scaling by partitioning the blockchain into smaller pieces:

```python
class Shard:
    def __init__(self, shard_id, validators):
        self.shard_id = shard_id
        self.validators = validators
        self.transactions = []
    
    def process_transactions(self):
        # Process transactions within shard
        pass
```
