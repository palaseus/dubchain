# Virtual Machine

This document explains the virtual machine implementation in DubChain for smart contract execution.

## Overview

The DubChain Virtual Machine (VM) is a stack-based execution environment designed for running smart contracts. It provides a secure, deterministic, and efficient platform for executing decentralized applications.

## VM Architecture

### Components

1. **Execution Engine**: Core VM execution logic
2. **Opcodes**: Instruction set for smart contracts
3. **Gas Meter**: Resource consumption tracking
4. **Contract Manager**: Smart contract lifecycle management

### Stack-Based Design

The VM uses a stack-based architecture where operations are performed on a stack of values:

```python
class VirtualMachine:
    def __init__(self):
        self.stack = []
        self.memory = {}
        self.storage = {}
        self.gas_limit = 0
        self.gas_used = 0
        self.pc = 0  # Program counter
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Contract Execution
```python
# Create VM instance
vm = VirtualMachine()

# Load contract bytecode
bytecode = compile_contract(contract_source)

# Execute contract
result = vm.execute(bytecode, input_data, gas_limit=1000000)
print(f"Execution result: {result}")
```

### Gas Optimization
```python
# Enable gas optimizations
vm.enable_gas_optimization()

# Execute with optimized gas usage
result = vm.execute_optimized(bytecode, input_data)
print(f"Gas used: {result.gas_used}")
```
